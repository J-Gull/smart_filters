Smart Filters
=============

Smart Filters is an implementation of what you see in the Smart Playlist dialog in iTunes but using ActiveRecord model as the table and columns as the data. It is wise enough to select different criteria based on the column type. See [Smart Filters Demo](http://github.com/monaqasat/smart_filters_demo) for testing in the development phases.
