The goal of this plugin is to create something very similar to the iTunes smart playlist concept, but for any ActiveRecord model.

    class Industry < ActiveRecord::Base
      has_many :companies
    end

    class Company < ActiveRecord::Base
      belongs_to :industry

      acts_as_smart_filterable :name => :string,
        :number_of_employees => :integer,
        :rating => :decimal,
        :created_at => :date,
        :industries_name => :string
    end
